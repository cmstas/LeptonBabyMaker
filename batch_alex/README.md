#Alex's Batch for LeptonBabyMaker 

###Description
This is an alternative batch system (it exists only because I find it a lot more intuitive).  Right now it only supports DY and runs at UCSD, but can be expanded as needed.  

###Instructions
  1. Make sure that everything works in the parent directory.
  2. ". copy.sh" (no quotes)
  3. ". submit.sh" (no quotes)

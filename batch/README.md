#Condor for Babymaker

This will submit the babymaker in the parent directory on Condor

Instructions (no quotes):
  -  Follow instructions in parent directory; this should work locally.  Make sure your CORE is up to date.
  -  ". copy.sh" to copy stuff from the parent directory to the batch directory.  Many of the files are modified as well.
  -  Open doBatch.sh and modify the two fields at the top to specify which baby should be produced
  -  ". doBatch.sh" to submit

Next Steps (Alex will do on 4/21 or 4/22)
  -  These jobs seem to always fail at certain sites, must be resubmitted.  Have e-mailed T2Support. (this is also a problem for the SS babymaker)
  -  Need a script that will submit every single job, not one at a time
  -  Need to support "smart" resubmissions (ie don't resubmit jobs that exist or are done)
  -  Need one script that will make every baby
  -  Need a merge script to merge the output into a single file
